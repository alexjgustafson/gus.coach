    <h2 class="text-neutral-content lg:text-4xl">Training Process</h2>
    <h3 class="text-neutral-content">1. Schedule Your First Session</h3>
    <p>Gus can meet you at a gym, bring his supplies to your garage or driveway, or you can come train at his home. If you're not sure what's right for you, we can figure it out together! Call or text (502) 472-3042 to schedule.</p>
    <h3 class="text-neutral-content">2. Learn the Lifts</h3>
    <p>Starting Strength trains the <a href="/squat">Squat</a>, <a href="press">Press</a>, <a href="/deadlift">Deadlift</a>, <a href="/bench-press">Bench Press</a>, and Power Clean. Gus will teach you how to safely and effectively perform each of these lifts.</p>
    <p>No previous experience is needed. We'll find your starting point!</p>
    <p>Even if you're an experienced lifter, you'll learn how Starting Strength trains the greatest amount of muscle mass over the longest effective range of motion.</p>
    <h3 class="text-neutral-content">3. Train with Gus and On Your Own</h3>
    <p>You'll be training multiple sessions per week. Schedule more time with Gus as possible, but we'll also teach you how to train on your own between coaching sessions.</p>
    <h3 class="text-neutral-content">4. Improved Results Every Week</h3>
    <p>Everyone starts with the Novice Linear Progression. You'll see the proof that you're getting stronger in your training log every week. Stick with this first simple program long enough, then Gus will coach you through Intermediate and Advanced programs once you're ready.</p>
